    <p>
      Ten years ago, a classmate’s parents let me stay in their home while I was
      looking for a job in post-2008 America. I went to my bedroom, sat on the
      edge of my bed, and called my (then) GF on the phone to break up with her
      —she was 3,000 miles away. After the demoralizing phone call, teary-eyed,
      I noticed there was a grey cat on the pillow.

      The cat was semi-transparent. And I just sat there, puzzled and
      heartbroken, watching that ghost cat lick his paw. I rubbed my eyes. A
      looked again. Still there. The cat dissolved like a hologram.
    </p>

    <p>Went to the couple who owned the home and told them. They opened a picture
      album and they showed me the cat. They told me it died a few years back, and
      liked to chill in my bedroom, often on top of the bed’s pillows. Still to
      this day the most confusing thing I have witnessed as far as believing or
      not believing in the supernatural.
